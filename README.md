## Problem Definition

Our project aims to develop a computer vision-based system for predicting the nutritional values of a plate by recognizing its constituent ingredients. Leveraging deep multi-label learning, our framework estimates the amount of food in the image and calculates the nutritional values of the food.

## Motivation

Our motivation lies in revolutionizing dietary assessment methodologies to promote healthier lifestyles by leveraging advancements in computer vision and machine learning. We aim to provide individuals with efficient, accurate, and accessible tools for assessing their dietary intake, empowering them to make informed nutritional choices and improve overall health outcomes.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the Nutrition5k dataset, which offers rich visual and nutritional data for 5,006 realistic plates of food. The dataset includes rotating side-angle videos, overhead RGB-D images, and detailed ingredient metadata. It fosters research in visual nutrition understanding by providing a comprehensive resource for algorithm development and evaluation.

## Quantitative Experiments

To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we plan to conduct quantitative experiments on the Nutrition5k dataset. We will measure the accuracy of our food recognition and nutritional estimation algorithms by comparing the predicted nutritional values with ground truth annotations. Performance metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and correlation coefficients will be calculated to assess the reliability and precision of our approach.

## Progress Plan

To ensure timely progress and successful completion of our project, we have outlined the following steps:

1. Implement data preprocessing techniques to clean and organize the dataset, including handling missing values and standardizing data formats.
2. Develop deep learning models for food recognition and nutritional estimation based on state-of-the-art architectures and techniques.
3. Train the models using the prepared dataset and fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize performance.
4. Evaluate the trained models on both training and testing splits of the dataset using appropriate evaluation metrics.
5. Analyze the experimental results, identify potential areas for improvement, and refine the models accordingly.
6. Prepare the progress report summarizing the methodology, experimental setup, results, and future directions.
